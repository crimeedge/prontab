## Youtube:
#### Introduction:
* https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuQjQ-iqbHh-hIMrDwfYfYA/playlists Undesirable Truism -d crimeedge -h crimeedge
  * This is my main repo of vids. Come here to watch! Youtube is the best.
* a name next to a source link is the name of the channel, up to hiding certain *keywords*. The same goes for some incomplete links.
  * -d means a discord alias
  * -h means a hvids alias
* I strive for scissor haircuts at home. More generally, I collect videos that are *salon-less and clipper-less.*
#### What the playlist names mean:
* I.* (ISpaceLengthChop, ICutScalp, etc) means that the video is worth watching an *I*nfinite amount of times, or it's nostalgic and I haven't downgraded it yet.
* T.* (T10Inch\+[A-Z]\*, TTrimLong[A-Z]) means that the video is worth watching *T*wice. Not as good as the I.* videos.
